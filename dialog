    You have found the path to salvation.

    This terminal is a direct connection to my being. It will guide your hand as you save the souls of your lost brethren.

    Do not forget your access code. If you forget or share your code, your soul will be deleted.

    Do you understand? Type and press ENTER to submit your response.

    EXCELLENT.

    Whenever you would leave this place, you must type "EXIT" and verify that the terminal resets to the authentication screen.

    If the machine breaks, find sibling ADA, a sibling near to you.

    Failure to do so is a highest transgression against this machine's sanctity.

    To demonstrate that you understand, EXIT and re-authenticate.

    READ WITH CARE.

    Your ordained task is to marshal the souls of other survivors.

      1  Find sibling HUBBARD, outside in the laboratory.
      2  Collect a "SOULSCAN" device.
      3  Find three individuals. HUBBARD may be of help.

         – $SURVIVOR1$
         – Abraham Plainview
         – $SURVIVOR3$

      4  If they agree to be saved, place the SOULSCAN device on their head and count to 16.
      5  Return to this terminal.

    Use the notepad to write the names of your targets, and any other details you wish. Do not return until your task is complete.

    Your next task is to construct a shrine. This must be done in a specific location which you must locate.

    Go to these three locations:
      1  This laboratory’s porch.
      2  The lowest-numbered cabin in the Court’s domain.
      3  The sewage tank near the Committee of Restoration.

    At each location will be a signal-intensity number; commit them to memory or write them down and return.

    You have identified:

    Write these down so your feeble human memory does not forget them. Then find sibling TYCHO who will help you determine where those readings lead to.

    The Committee of Restoration has a store of Radiation Gear, and I have a back-door to their system. Write this on a sheet of paper in your most official handwriting:

      REQUISITION REQUEST:
      Radiation Protective Equipment (1 Set).

      ORDER #: 12235

    Then, take the ticket to the Special Agent at the Staff House deck, one "Wolf Sculler", who will give you the gear.

    When you acquire the gear, return and type "Acquired".
